He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/James_McKeen_Cattell" title="James McKeen Cattell">James McKeen Cattell</a>, a student of <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt" title="Wilhelm Wundt">Wilhelm Wundt</a> who had been reading Galton&apos;s articles, decided he wanted to study under him.

</p><p>In 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton&apos;s lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHergenhahnHenley2013288_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHergenhahnHenley2013288-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> titled &apos;Africa for the Chinese&apos;, where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<sup id="cite_ref-TheTimes1873_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TheTimes1873-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>The publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species" class="mw-redirect" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i> in 1859 was an event that changed Galton&apos;s life .<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEForrest197484_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEForrest197484-24">[24]</a></sup> He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on &quot;Variation under Domestication&quot;, concerning <a href="/wiki/Animal_breeding" title="Animal breeding">animal breeding</a>.
</p><p>Galton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.
</p><p>Galton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was <a href="/wiki/Hereditary" class="mw-redirect" title="Hereditary">hereditary</a>, and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of <a href="/wiki/Historiometry" title="Historiometry">historiometry</a>. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book <i>Hereditary Genius</i> in 1869.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1869_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1869-3">[3]</a></sup> Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_of_intelligence" class="mw-redirect" title="Inheritance of intelligence">inheritance of abilities</a>.
</p><p>Galton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper <i>The history of twins</i> in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of <a href="/wiki/Behaviour_genetics" class="mw-redirect" title="Behaviour genetics">behaviour genetics</a>, which relies heavily on <a href="/wiki/Twin_studies" class="mw-redirect" title="Twin studies">twin studies</a>. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed <a href="/wiki/Adoption_study" title="Adoption study">adoption studies</a>, including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.
</p><p>Galton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation&apos;s citizens, and their <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_success" title="Reproductive success">reproductive success</a>. In <i>Hereditary Genius</i>, he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:
</p><p>The best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.</p><p>Galton invented the term <i><a href="/wiki/Eugenics" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a></i> in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, <i><a href="/wiki/Inquiries_into_Human_Faculty_and_Its_Development" title="Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development">Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1883_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1883-7">[7]</a></sup> He believed that a scheme of &apos;marks&apos; for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were <i><a href="/wiki/Dysgenics" title="Dysgenics">dysgenic</a></i>. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Eugenics_Review" title="The Eugenics Review">The Eugenics Review</a></i>, the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a-21">[21]</a></sup> The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a_21-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton&apos;s formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton&apos;s first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  <i>Hereditary Genius</i>, generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStigler2010469&#x2013;482_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStigler2010469&#x2013;482-25">[25]</a></sup> This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: &quot;If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton191457_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton191457-26">[26]</a></sup>
</p><p>This notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton&apos;s solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the <a href="/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" class="mw-redirect" title="British Association for the Advancement of Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-28">[28]</a></sup> The address was published in <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a>,</i> and Galton further developed the theory in  &quot;Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature&quot; and &quot;Hereditary Stature.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1886246&#x2013;263_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1886246&#x2013;263-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1886b295&#x2013;298_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1886b295&#x2013;298-30">[30]</a></sup> An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in <i>Natural Inheritance.</i> There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874&#x2013;1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton&apos;s development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the <a href="/wiki/Bean_machine" title="Bean machine">quincunx</a> (&apos;bean machine&apos;) and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533-31">[31]</a></sup> Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled <i>Typical Laws of Heredity</i> at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Institution" title="Royal Institution">Royal Institution</a> in London.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533_31-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533-31">[31]</a></sup> In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStigler2010469&#x2013;482_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStigler2010469&#x2013;482-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533_31-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1877492&#x2013;495,_512&#x2013;514,_532&#x2013;533-31">[31]</a></sup> He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent&apos;s weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, &quot;I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-:3_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299_27-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStigler1986265&#x2013;299-27">[27]</a></sup> Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.
</p><p>The model for population stability resulted in Galton&apos;s formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in <i>Natural Inheritance,</i> states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring&apos;s heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring&apos;s heritage.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulmer1998579&#x2013;585_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBulmer1998579&#x2013;585-32">[32]</a></sup> Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001b1383&#x2013;1392_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001b1383&#x2013;1392-33">[33]</a></sup> When <a href="/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance" title="Mendelian inheritance">Mendel&apos;s</a> principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton&apos;s Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel&apos;s principles.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham201361&#x2013;75_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham201361&#x2013;75-34">[34]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin&apos;s hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Pangenesis" title="Pangenesis">pangenesis</a>. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Gemmules" class="mw-redirect" title="Gemmules">gemmules</a>&quot; moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<sup id="cite_ref-abc.net.au_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-abc.net.au-35">[35]</a></sup> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulmer2003116&#x2013;118_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBulmer2003116&#x2013;118-36">[36]</a></sup>
</p><p>Darwin challenged the validity of Galton&apos;s experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> where he wrote:
</p><p>Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my <i><a href="/wiki/Variation_of_Animals_and_Plants_under_Domestication" class="mw-redirect" title="Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication">Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</a></i> I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &amp;c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton&apos;s experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.</p><p>Galton explicitly rejected the idea of the <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics" class="mw-redirect" title="Inheritance of acquired characteristics">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lamarckism" title="Lamarckism">Lamarckism</a>), and was an early proponent of &quot;hard heredity&quot; <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulmer2003105&#x2013;107_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBulmer2003105&#x2013;107-37">[37]</a></sup> through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel&apos;s particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as <a href="/wiki/Polygenic" class="mw-redirect" title="Polygenic">polygenic</a> traits). He went on to found the <a href="/wiki/Biostatistics" title="Biostatistics">biometric</a> approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.
</p><p>This approach was later taken up enthusiastically by <a href="/wiki/Karl_Pearson" title="Karl Pearson">Karl Pearson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Raphael_Weldon" title="Raphael Weldon">W. F. R. Weldon</a>; together, they founded the highly influential journal <i><a href="/wiki/Biometrika" title="Biometrika">Biometrika</a></i> in 1901.  (<a href="/wiki/R._A._Fisher" class="mw-redirect" title="R. A. Fisher">R. A.

</p><p>In 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to &quot;show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221-39">[39]</a></sup> The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.
</p><p>First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects&apos; heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221_39-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221-39">[39]</a></sup>
</p><p>One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1884_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1884-40">[40]</a></sup> The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.
</p><p>Although the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221_39-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221-39">[39]</a></sup>
</p><p>Galton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child&apos;s eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221_39-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1885205-221-39">[39]</a></sup> The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1884_40-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1884-40">[40]</a></sup>
</p><p>After the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write <i>Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001c82-102_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001c82-102-41">[41]</a></sup> In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when &quot;the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1888273-279_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1888273-279-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>The method used in <i>Hereditary Genius</i> has been described as the first example of <a href="/wiki/Historiometry" title="Historiometry">historiometry</a>. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between &apos;nature&apos; and &apos;nurture&apos; (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 <a href="/wiki/Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society" class="mw-redirect" title="Fellows of the Royal Society">Fellows of the Royal Society</a>. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as <a href="/wiki/Birth_order" title="Birth order">birth order</a> and the occupation and <a href="/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" class="mw-redirect" title="Race (classification of human beings)">race</a> of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was &apos;innate&apos; or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, <i>English men of science: their nature and nurture</i>, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the <a href="/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture" title="Nature versus nurture">nature versus nurture</a> question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.
</p><p>Sir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the <a href="/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" title="Lexical hypothesis">lexical hypothesis</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECapraraCervone200068_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTECapraraCervone200068-43">[43]</a></sup> This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people&apos;s lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human <a href="/wiki/Personality_traits" class="mw-redirect" title="Personality traits">personality traits</a>.
</p><p>Galton&apos;s inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people&apos;s subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as <a href="/wiki/Visual_memory" title="Visual memory">mental imagery</a>. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the <a href="/wiki/Questionnaire" title="Questionnaire">questionnaire</a>. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEClauser2007440-444_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClauser2007440-444-44">[44]</a></sup>
</p><p>Core to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a <a href="/wiki/Central_tendency" title="Central tendency">central tendency</a>, or mean, and a spread around this central value, or <a href="/wiki/Variance" title="Variance">variance</a>.

</p><p>Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal&apos;s weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that &quot;the middlemost estimate expresses the <i>vox populi</i>, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters&quot;,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1907450_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1907450-46">[46]</a></sup> and reported this value (the <a href="/wiki/Median" title="Median">median</a>, in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWallis2014420-424_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWallis2014420-424-48">[48]</a></sup> has found some slips in transmitting Galton&apos;s calculations to the original article in <i>Nature</i>: the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESurowiecki2004_49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTESurowiecki2004-49">[49]</a></sup> uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.
</p><p>The same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal <i><a href="/wiki/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i> a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1906173_50-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1906173-50">[50]</a></sup>
</p><p>Studying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a <a href="/wiki/Pachinko" title="Pachinko">pachinko</a>-like device also known as the <a href="/wiki/Bean_machine" title="Bean machine">bean machine</a>, as a tool for demonstrating the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_error" class="mw-redirect" title="Law of error">law of error</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Normal_distribution" title="Normal distribution">normal distribution</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulmer20034_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBulmer20034-9">[9]</a></sup>

Galton<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1889_57-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1889-57">[57]</a></sup> developed the following model: pellets fall through a <i><a href="/wiki/Quincunx" title="Quincunx">quincunx</a></i> or &quot;<a href="/wiki/Bean_machine" title="Bean machine">bean machine</a>&quot; forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point.

</p><p>The answer was not &quot;on average directly above&quot;. Rather it was &quot;on average, more towards the middle&quot;, for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.</p><p>Galton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and <a href="/wiki/Hearing_(sense)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hearing (sense)">hearing</a>, and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a_21-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGillham2001a-21">[21]</a></sup> It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.
</p><p>Galton&apos;s study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of <a href="/wiki/Differential_psychology" title="Differential psychology">differential psychology</a> and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction
time.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJensen2002145-172_58-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJensen2002145-172-58">[58]</a></sup> He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.
</p><p>Galton also devised a technique called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Composite_portrait" title="Composite portrait">composite portraiture</a>&quot; (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals&apos; faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see <a href="/wiki/Averageness" title="Averageness">averageness</a>). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the <a href="/wiki/Attractiveness" title="Attractiveness">attractiveness</a> of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> in his work on dreams, picked up Galton&apos;s suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an <a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">Ideal type</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concept</a> of a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Natural_kind" title="Natural kind">natural kind</a>&quot; (see <a href="/wiki/Eleanor_Rosch" title="Eleanor Rosch">Eleanor Rosch</a>)&#x2014;such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.&#x2014;onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or &quot;composite&quot;, that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an &quot;average&quot; or &quot;central type&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1883_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1883-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalton1878132&#x2013;142_59-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalton1878132&#x2013;142-59">[59]</a></sup> (See also entry <i>Modern physiognomy</i> under <a href="/wiki/Physiognomy" title="Physiognomy">Physiognomy</a>).
</p><p>This work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Jacobs" title="Joseph Jacobs">Joseph Jacobs</a> studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENovak2008100_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovak2008100-60">[60]</a></sup> One of Jacobs&apos; first publications that used Galton&apos;s composite imagery was &quot;The Jewish Type, and Galton&apos;s Composite Photographs,&quot; <i>Photographic News</i>, 29, (24 April 1885): 268&#x2013;269.
</p><p>Galton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Hine" title="Lewis Hine">Lewis Hine</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_L._Lovell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John L.

He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.
</p><p>The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir <a href="/wiki/William_James_Herschel" class="mw-redirect" title="William James Herschel">William James Herschel</a> in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr <a href="/wiki/Henry_Faulds" title="Henry Faulds">Henry Faulds</a> in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, who was a friend of Fauld&apos;s, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBulmer200335_62-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBulmer200335-62">[62]</a></sup>) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_63-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BBC-63">[63]</a></sup> Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEInnes200532&#x2013;33_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEInnes200532&#x2013;33-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p><p>In an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled <i>Kantsaywhere</i> from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed <a href="/wiki/Fitness_(biology)" title="Fitness (biology)">fitter</a> and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to <a href="/wiki/Methuen_Publishing" title="Methuen Publishing">Methuen</a> for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either &quot;smothered or superseded&quot;. His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPearson1930a413_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPearson1930a413-65">[65]</a></sup> and it was published online by University College, London.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGaltonSargent2001191-209_66-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGaltonSargent2001191-209-66">[66]</a></sup>
